# Noggle Browser

**Please make sure you have all prerequisites installed before making an issue. Saves a lot of time. Thanks!**

A new browsing experience that's really... really... slow. Not internet explorer slow, but whatever. Based on Chromium. Coded in Python using PyQt5. Designed for NationStates.

## Prerequisites

Python 3, PyQt5, PyQtWebEngine

### Windows and MacOS

[https://www.python.org/downloads/](Download Python)

Get PyQt5 via pip
`pip install PyQt5`

Get PyQtWebEngine via pip
`pip install PyQtWebEngine`

### Linux

#### Debian and Ubuntu

Python 3 should come preinstalled on your Debian installation and your Ubuntu installation if it isn't from 2008. Make sure it's on your installation by running `python3` on the command line.

For PyQt5 use `sudo apt install python3-pyqt5`

For PyQtWebEngine use `sudo apt install python3-pyqt5.qtwebengine`

#### Other Distributions

Python 3 should still come preinstalled on most Linux distributions. For PyQt5 and PyQtWebEngine, check with your distribution's package list.

Some package lists:

[https://src.fedoraproject.org/](Fedora)
[https://archlinux.org/packages/](Arch)
[https://packages.gentoo.org/](Gentoo)
[http://packages.linuxmint.com/](Linux Mint)
[https://discover.manjaro.org/packages/](Manjaro)

## Running the Program

Navigate to the directory the `noggle.py` file is in, which will be 2 directories down from the place you extracted to. Then run the command `python3 noggle.py` or run it directly from your file manager.

## Known Issues

On sites that open links in new tabs, you'll have to middle click the link that opens in a new tab. The fix for this would be to add tabs, which I can't be bothered to do right now, but will probably eventually fix it.

## Trying to Install Extensions

It won't work :)
